SuperDB's first GA release is expected in the Summer of 2025. Ongoing changes
will be documented here once that release is made available. To try out
SuperDB while it's still under development we recommend starting from the
[`super` command doc](https://superdb.org/docs/commands/super/).

The SuperDB codebase originates from the [Zed project](https://zed.brimdata.io/)
which is no longer under active development. While the full Zed commit history
is still present in this repo, the detailed
[CHANGELOG of prior Zed releases](https://github.com/brimdata/zed-archive/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
is available in the [zed-archive repo](https://github.com/brimdata/zed-archive/tree/main)
along with all [prior Zed release tags](https://github.com/brimdata/zed-archive/tags)
and the [final GA Zed release](https://github.com/brimdata/zed-archive/releases).
