### Description

TODO: get rid of personality metaphor?

The `serve` command implements the [server personality](db.md#command-personalities) to service requests
from instances of the client personality.
It listens for [lake API](../lake/api.md) requests on the interface and port
specified by the `-l` option, executes the requests, and returns results.

The `-log.level` option controls log verbosity.  Available levels, ordered
from most to least verbose, are `debug`, `info` (the default), `warn`,
`error`, `dpanic`, `panic`, and `fatal`.  If the volume of logging output at
the default `info` level seems too excessive for production use, `warn` level
is recommended.

The `-manage` option enables the running of the same maintenance tasks
normally performed via the separate [`manage`](#manage) command.
