### Description

The `query` command runs a [SuperSQL](../language/_index.md) query with data from a lake as input.
A query typically begins with a [`from` operator](../language/operators/from.md)
indicating the pool and branch to use as input.

The pool/branch names are specified with `from` in the query.

As with [`super`](super.md), the default output format is SUP for
terminals and BSUP otherwise, though this can be overridden with
`-f` to specify one of the various supported output formats.

If a pool name is provided to `from` without a branch name, then branch
"main" is assumed.

This example reads every record from the full key range of the `logs` pool
and sends the results to stdout.

```
super db query 'from logs'
```

We can narrow the span of the query by specifying a filter on the [pool key](#pool-key):
```
super db query 'from logs | ts >= 2018-03-24T17:36:30.090766Z and ts <= 2018-03-24T17:36:30.090758Z'
```
Filters on pool keys are efficiently implemented as the data is laid out
according to the pool key and seek indexes keyed by the pool key
are computed for each data object.

When querying data to the [BSUP](../formats/bsup.md) output format,
output from a pool can be easily piped to other commands like `super`, e.g.,
```
super db query -f bsup 'from logs' | super -f table -c 'count() by field' -
```
Of course, it's even more efficient to run the query inside of the pool traversal
like this:
```
super db query -f table 'from logs | count() by field'
```
By default, the `query` command scans pool data in pool-key order though
the query optimizer may, in general, reorder the scan to optimize searches,
aggregations, and joins.
An order hint can be supplied to the `query` command to indicate to
the optimizer the desired processing order, but in general, [`sort` operators](../language/operators/sort.md)
should be used to guarantee any particular sort order.

Arbitrarily complex queries can be executed over the lake in this fashion
and the planner can utilize cloud resources to parallelize and scale the
query over many parallel workers that simultaneously access the lake data in
shared cloud storage (while also accessing locally- or cluster-cached copies of data).

#### Meta-queries

Commit history, metadata about data objects, lake and pool configuration,
etc. can all be queried and
returned as super-structured data, which in turn, can be fed into analytics.
This allows a very powerful approach to introspecting the structure of a
lake making it easy to measure, tune, and adjust lake parameters to
optimize layout for performance.

These structures are introspected using meta-queries that simply
specify a metadata source using an extended syntax in the `from` operator.
There are three types of meta-queries:
* `from :<meta>` - lake level
* `from pool:<meta>` - pool level
* `from pool[@<branch>]<:meta>` - branch level

`<meta>` is the name of the metadata being queried. The available metadata
sources vary based on level.

For example, a list of pools with configuration data can be obtained
in the SUP format as follows:
```
super db query -S "from :pools"
```
This meta-query produces a list of branches in a pool called `logs`:
```
super db query -S "from logs:branches"
```
You can filter the results just like any query,
e.g., to look for particular branch:
```
super db query -S "from logs:branches | branch.name=='main'"
```

This meta-query produces a list of the data objects in the `live` branch
of pool `logs`:
```
super db query -S "from logs@live:objects"
```

You can also pretty-print in human-readable form most of the metadata records
using the "lake" format, e.g.,
```
super db query -f lake "from logs@live:objects"
```

The `main` branch is queried by default if an explicit branch is not specified,
e.g.,

```
super db query -f lake "from logs:objects"
```
