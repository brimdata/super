### Time Types

> _WARNING: These data types are going to change in a forthcoming release of SuperSQL._

The `time` type represents an unsigned 64-bit number of nanoseconds since epoch.

The `duration` type represents a signed 64-bit number of nanoseconds.

These data types are incompatible with SQL data and time types.  A future version
of SuperSQL will change the `time` type to be SQL compatible and add support for other 
SQL date/time and interval types.  At that time, detailed syntax and semantics
for these types will be documented here.
