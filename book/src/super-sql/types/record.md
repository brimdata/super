# Records

Records conform to the
[record type](../../formats/model.md#21-record) in the
super-structured data model and follow the
[syntax](../../formats/sup.md#251-record-type)
of records in the [SUP format](../../formats/sup.md), i.e.,
a record type has the form
```
{ <name> : <type>, <name> : <type>, ... }
```
where `<name>` is an identifier or string
and `<type>` is any type.

Any SUP text defining a [record value](../../formats/sup.md#241-record-value)
is a valid record literal in the SuperSQL language.

For example, this is a simple record value
```
{number:1,message:"hello,world"}
```
whose type is
```
{number:int64,message:string}
```
An empty record value and an empty record type are both represented as `{}`.

Records can be created by reading external data (SUP files,
database data, Parquet values, JSON objects, etc) or by
constructing instances using
[record expressions](#record-expressions) or other
SuperSQL functions that produce records.

## Record Expressions

Record values are constructed from a _record expression_ that is comprised of
zero or more comma-separated elements contained in braces:
```
{ <element>, <element>, ... }
```
where an `<element>` has one of three forms:

* a named field of the form `<name> : <expr>`  where `<name>` is an
identifier or string and `<expr>` is any [expression](../expressions/intro.md),
* any [expression](../expressions/intro.md) by itself where the field name
  is derived from the expression text as defined below, or
* a spread expression of the form `...<expr>` where `<expr>` is an arbitrary
[expression](../expressions/intro.md) that should evaluate to a record value.

The spread form inserts all of the fields from the resulting record.
If a spread expression results in a non-record type (e.g., errors), then that
part of the record is simply elided.  Note that the field names for
the spread come from the constituent record values.

The fields of a record expression are evaluated left to right and when
field names collide the rightmost instance of the name determines that
field's value.

## Derived Field Names

When an expression is present without a field name,
the field name is derived from the expression text as follows:
* for a dotted path expression, the name is the last element of the path;
* for a function or aggregate function, the name is the name of the function;
* for a double-quoted token, the name is the text between the quotes;
* for `this`, the name is `that`;
* otherwise, the name is the expression text formatted in a canonical form.

>[!NOTE]
> The double-quote rule follows from the dual meaning of double quotes for
> [string types](string.md): in a SQL expression a double-quoted token is a field
> identifier, while in a pipe expression it is a string. The derived field name
> comes from the quoted text in both cases. A consequence in pipe expressions
> is that a double-quoted string and a single-quoted string of equal value
> derive different names, since only the former matches this rule and the
> latter falls through to the canonical form.

## Examples

---

_A simple record literal_

```mdtest-spq
# spq
values {a:1,b:2,s:"hello"}
# input

# expected output
{a:1,b:2,s:"hello"}
```

---

_A record expression with spreads operating on various input values_

```mdtest-spq
# spq
values {a:0},{x}, {...r}, {a:0,...r,b:3}
# input
{x:1,y:2,r:{a:1,b:2}}
# expected output
{a:0}
{x:1}
{a:1,b:2}
{a:1,b:3}
```

---

_A record literal with casts_

```mdtest-spq {data-layout="stacked"}
# spq
type CustomString=string
values {b:true,u:1::uint8,a:[1,2,3],s:"hello"::CustomString}
# input

# expected output
type CustomString=string
{b:true,u:1::uint8,a:[1,2,3],s:"hello"::CustomString}
```

---

_Various derived field names_

```mdtest-spq {data-layout="stacked"}
# spq
values {a.b,upper(a.b),"x y",'x y',this,a.b || "d"}
# input
{a:{b:"c"}}
# expected output
{b:"c",upper:"C","x y":"x y","\"x y\"":"x y",that:{a:{b:"c"}},"a.b||\"d\"":"cd"}
```

---

_Derived field names inside a SELECT_

```mdtest-spq
# spq
select {1+2*3} as x,sum(a)
# input
{a:1}
{a:2}
# expected output
{x:{"1+2*3":7},sum:3}
```
