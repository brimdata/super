### Network Types

The `ip` type represents an internet address and supports both
IPv4 and IPv6 variations.  The `net` type represents an `ip` value
with a contiguous network mask as indicated by the number of bits
in the mask.

A 32-bit IPv4 address is formed using dotted-decimal notation, e.g., 
a string of base-256 decimal numbers separated by `.` as in 
`128.32.130.100` or `10.0.0.1`.

A 128-bit IPv6 is formed from a sequence of eight groups of four 
hecadecimal digits separated by colons (`:`).

For IPv6 addresses,
leading zeros in each group can be omitted (e.g., the sequence `2001:0db8`
becomes `2001:db8`) and consecutive groups of zeros can be compressed
using a double colon (`::`) but this can only be done once to avoid ambiguity, e.g.,
```
2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001
```
can be expressed as `2001:db8::1`.

A value of type `net` is formed as an IPv4 or IPv6 address followed by a slash (`/`) 
followed by a decimal integer indicating the numbers of bits of contiguous network as 
in `128.32.130.100/24` or `fc00::/7`.

Note that unlike other SQL dialects that require IP addresses and networks to be formatted
inside quotation marks, SuperSQL treats these data types as first-class elements that
need not be quoted.
