### Null

The null type represents a type that has just one value:
the special value `null`.

A value of type `null` is formed simply from the keyword `null` 
representing the null value, which by default, is type `null`.

While all types include a null value, e.g., `null::int64` is the 
null value whose type is `int64`, the null type has no other values
besides the null value.

In relational SQL, a null typically indicates an unknown value.
Unfortunately, this concept is overloaded as unkown values may arise
from runtime errors, missing data, or an intentional value of null.

Because SuperSQL has [_first-class errors_](error.md) (obviating the need to
serialize error conditions as fixed-type nulls)
and [_sum types_](union.md) (obviating the need to flatten sum types into columns and
occupy the absent component types with nulls), the use of null values is
discouraged.

That said, SuperSQL supports the null value for backward compatibility with
their pervasive use in SQL, database systems, programming languages, and serialization
formats.

As in SQL, to test if a value is null, it cannot be compared to another null 
value, which by definition, is always false, i.e., two unknown values cannot
be known to be equal.  Instead the [`IS NULL`](../expressions.md#comparisons) operator or 
[coalesce](../functions/generics/coalesce.md) function should be used.


#### Examples
---
_The null value_

```mdtest-spq
# spq
values typeof(null)
# input
null
# expected output
<null>
```

---

_Test for null with IS NULL_

```mdtest-spq
# spq
values
  this IS NULL,
  this == null,
  this == null ? "null == null" : "null != null"
# input
null
# expected output
true
null::bool
"null != null"
```

---

_Missing values are not null values_

```mdtest-spq
# spq
values {out:y}
# input
{x:1}
{x:2,y:3}
null
# expected output
{out:error("missing")}
{out:3}
{out:error("missing")}
```

---

_Use coalesce to easily skip over nulls and missing values_

```mdtest-spq
# spq
const DEFAULT = 100
values coalesce(y,x,DEFAULT)
# input
{x:1}
{x:2,y:3}
{x:4,y:null}
null
# expected output
1
3
4
100
```

---

_All types have a null value_

```mdtest-spq
# spq
values null::this
# input
<int64>
<string>
<int64|string>
<{x:int64,s:string}>
<[string]>
# expected output
null::int64
null::string
null::(int64|string)
null::{x:int64,s:string}
null::[string]
```
