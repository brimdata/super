### Operator

&emsp; **shapes** &mdash; aggregate sample values by type

### Synopsis
```
shapes [ <expr> ]
```
### Description

The `shapes` operator aggregates the values computed by `<expr>`
by type and produces an arbitrary sample value for each unique type
in the input.  It ignores null values and errors.

`shapes` is a shorthand for
```
where <expr> is not null
| aggregate sample:=any(<expr>) by typeof(this)
| values sample
```

If `<expr>` is not present, then `this` is presumed.

### Examples

---

```mdtest-spq
# spq
shapes | sort
# input
1
2
3
"foo"
"bar"
null
error(1)
# expected output
1
"foo"
```

```mdtest-spq
# spq
shapes a | sort
# input
{a:1}
{b:2}
{a:"foo"}
# expected output
1
"foo"
```
