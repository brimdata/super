### Operator

&emsp; **aggregate** &mdash; execute aggregate functions with optional grouping expressions

### Synopsis

```
[aggregate] <agg> [, <agg> ... ] [ by <grouping> [, <grouping> ... ] ]
[aggregate] by <grouping> [, <grouping> ... ]
```
where `<agg>` is an aggregate function [field assignment](intro.md#field-assignment)
with an optional filter having the form:
```
[ <field> := ] <agg-func> ( <expr> ) [ where <expr> ]
```
and `<grouping>` is a grouping expression [field assignment](intro.md#field-assignment)
having the form:
```
[ <field> := ] <expr>
```

### Description

The `aggregate` operator applies
[aggregate functions](../aggregates/intro.md) to
partitioned groups of its input values to reduce each group to one output value
where the result of each aggregate function appears as a field of the result.

Each group corresponds to the unique values of the `<grouping>` expressions.
When there are no `<grouping>` expressions, the aggregate functions are applied
to the entire input.

In the first form, the `aggregate` operator consumes all of its input,
applies one or more aggregate functions `<agg>` to each input value
optionally filtered by a `where` clause and/or organized with the grouping
expressions specified after the `by` keyword, and at the end of input produces one
or more aggregations for each unique set of grouping key values.

In the second form, `aggregate` consumes all of its input, then outputs each
unique combination of values of the grouping expressions specified after the `by`
keyword without applying any aggregate functions.

The `aggregate` keyword is optional since it can be used as a
[shortcut](../shortcuts.md).

Each aggregate function `<agg-func>` may be optionally followed by a `where` clause,
which applies a Boolean expression `<expr>` that indicates, for each input value,
whether to include it in the values operated upon by the aggregate function.
`where` clauses are analogous
to the [`where` operator](where.md) but apply their filter to the input
argument stream to the aggregate function.

The output values are records formed from the [field assignments](intro.md#field-assignment)
first from the grouping expressions then from the aggregate functions
in left-to-right order.

When the result of `aggregate` is a single value (e.g., a single aggregate
function without grouping expressions) and there is no field name specified, then
the output is that single value rather than a single-field record
containing that value.

If the cardinality of grouping expressions causes the memory footprint to exceed
a limit, then each aggregate's partial results are spilled to temporary storage
and the results merged into final results using an external merge sort.

> _Spilling is not yet implemented for the vectorized runtime._

### Examples

---

_Average the input sequence_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
aggregate avg(this)
# input
1
2
3
4
# expected output
2.5
```

---

_To format the output of a single-valued aggregation into a record, simply specify
an explicit field for the output_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
aggregate mean:=avg(this)
# input
1
2
3
4
# expected output
{mean:2.5}
```

---

_When multiple aggregate functions are specified, even without explicit field names,
a record result is generated with field names implied by the functions_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
aggregate avg(this),sum(this),count()
# input
1
2
3
4
# expected output
{avg:2.5,sum:10,count:4::uint64}
```

---

_Sum the input sequence, leaving out the `aggregate` keyword_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
sum(this)
# input
1
2
3
4
# expected output
10
```

---

_Create integer sets by key and sort the output to get a deterministic order_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
set:=union(v) by key:=k | sort
# input
{k:"foo",v:1}
{k:"bar",v:2}
{k:"foo",v:3}
{k:"baz",v:4}
# expected output
{key:"bar",set:|[2]|}
{key:"baz",set:|[4]|}
{key:"foo",set:|[1,3]|}
```

---

_Use a `where` clause_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
set:=union(v) where v > 1 by key:=k | sort
# input
{k:"foo",v:1}
{k:"bar",v:2}
{k:"foo",v:3}
{k:"baz",v:4}
# expected output
{key:"bar",set:|[2]|}
{key:"baz",set:|[4]|}
{key:"foo",set:|[3]|}
```

---

_Use a separate `where` clause on each aggregate function_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
set:=union(v) where v > 1,
array:=collect(v) where k=="foo"
  by key:=k
| sort
# input
{k:"foo",v:1}
{k:"bar",v:2}
{k:"foo",v:3}
{k:"baz",v:4}
# expected output
{key:"bar",set:|[2]|,array:null}
{key:"baz",set:|[4]|,array:null}
{key:"foo",set:|[3]|,array:[1,3]}
```

---

_Results are included for `by` groupings that generate null results when `where`
clauses are used inside `aggregate`_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
sum(v) where k=="bar" by key:=k | sort
# input
{k:"foo",v:1}
{k:"bar",v:2}
{k:"foo",v:3}
{k:"baz",v:4}
# expected output
{key:"bar",sum:2}
{key:"baz",sum:null}
{key:"foo",sum:null}
```

---

_To avoid null results for `by` groupings as just shown, filter before `aggregate`_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
k=="bar" | sum(v) by key:=k | sort
# input
{k:"foo",v:1}
{k:"bar",v:2}
{k:"foo",v:3}
{k:"baz",v:4}
# expected output
{key:"bar",sum:2}
```

---

_Output just the unique key values_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
by k | sort
# input
{k:"foo",v:1}
{k:"bar",v:2}
{k:"foo",v:3}
{k:"baz",v:4}
# expected output
{k:"bar"}
{k:"baz"}
{k:"foo"}
```
