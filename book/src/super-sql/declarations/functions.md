## Functions

New functions are declared with the syntax
```
fn <id> ( [<param> [, <param> ...]] ) : <expr>
```
where
* `<id>` is an identifier representing the name of the function,
* each `<param>` is an identifier representing a positional argument to the function, and
* `<expr>` is any [expression](../expressions/intro.md) that implements the function.

Function declarations must appear in the declaration section of a [scope](../syntax.md#scope).

The function body `<expr>` may refer the passed-in arguments by name.

Specifically, the references to the named parameters are
field references of the special value `this`, as in any expression.
In particular, the value of `this` referenced in a function body
is formed as record from the actual values passed to the function
where the field names correspond to the parameters of the function.

For example, the function `add` as defined by
```
fn add(a,b): a+b
```
when invoked as
```
values {x:1} | values add(x,1)
```
is passed the record the `{a:x,b:1}`, which after resolving `x` to `1`,
is `{a:1,b:1}` and thus evaluates the expression
```
this.a + this.b
```
which results in `2`.

Any function-as-value arguments passed to a function do not appear in the `this`
record formed from the parameters.  Instead, function values are expanded at their
call sites in a macro-like fashion.

Functions may be recursive.  If the maximum call stack depth is exceeded,
the function returns an error value indicating so.  Recursive functions that
run for an extended period of time without exceeding the stack depth will simply
be allowed to run indefinitely and stall the query result.

### Subquery Functions

Since the body of a function is any expression and an expression may be
a subquery, function bodies can be defined as [subqueries](../expressions/subqueries.md).
This leads to the commonly used pattern of a subquery function:
```
fn <id> ( [<param> [, <param> ...]] ) : (
    <query>
)
```
where `<query>` is any [query](../syntax.md) and is simply wrapped in parentheses
to form the subquery.

As with any subquery, when multiple results are expected, an array subquery
may be used by wrapping `<query>` in square brackets instead of parentheses:
```
fn <id> ( [<param> [, <param> ...]] ) : [
    <query>
]
```


### Examples

---

_A simple function that adds two numbers_

```mdtest-spq
# spq
fn add(a,b): a+b
values add(x,y)
# input
{x:1,y:2}
{x:2,y:2}
{x:3,y:3}
# expected output
3
4
6
```

---

_A simple recursive function_

```mdtest-spq
# spq
fn fact(n): n<=1 ? 1 : n*fact(n-1)
values fact(5)
# input
null
# expected output
120
```
---
_A subquery function that computes some stats over numeric arrays_

```mdtest-spq
# spq
fn stats(numbers): (
    unnest numbers
    | sort this
    | avg(this),min(this),max(this),mode:=collect(this)
    | mode:=mode[(len(mode)/2)+1]
) 
values stats(a)
# input
{a:[3,1,2]}
{a:[4]}
# expected output
{avg:2.,min:1,max:3,mode:2}
{avg:4.,min:4,max:4,mode:4}
```
---
_Function arguments are actually fields in the "this" record_

```mdtest-spq
# spq
fn that(a,b,c): this
values that(x,y,3)
# input
{x:1,y:2}
# expected output
{a:1,b:2,c:3}
```
---
_Functions passed as values do not appear in the "this" record_

```mdtest-spq
# spq
fn apply(f,arg):{that:this,result:f(arg)}
fn square(x):x*x
values apply(&square,val)
# input
{val:1}
{val:2}
# expected output
{that:{arg:1},result:1}
{that:{arg:2},result:4}
```
