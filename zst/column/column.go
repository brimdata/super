// Package column implements the organization of columns on storage for a
// ZST columnar storage object.
//
// A ZST object is created by allocating a Writer for any top-level Zed type
// via NewWriter.  The object to be written is wrapped
// in a Spiller with a column threshold.  Output is streamed to the underlying spiller
// in a single pass.  (In the future, we may implement multiple passes to optimize
// the storage layout of column data or spread a given ZST object across multiple
// files.
//
// NewWriter recursively decends into the Zed type, allocating a Writer
// for each node in the type tree.  The top-level body is written via a call
// to Write.  The columns buffer data in memory until they reach their
// byte threshold or until Flush is called.
//
// After all of the Zed data is written, a reassembly map is formed for
// each column writer by calling its EncodeMap method, which builds the
// value in place using zcode.Builder and returns the Zed type of
// the reassembly map value.
//
// Data is read from a ZST file by scanning the reassembly maps to build
// column Readers for each Zed type by calling NewReader with the map, which
// recusirvely builds an assembly structure.  An io.ReaderAt is passed to NewReader
// so each column reader can access the underlying storage object and read its
// column data effciently in largish column chunks.
//
// Once an assembly is built, the recontructed Zed row data can be read from the
// assembly by calling the Read method on the top-level Record and passing in
// a zcode.Builder to reconstruct the record body in place.  The assembly does not
// need any type information as the structure of values is entirely self describing
// in the Zed data format.
