// Package column implements the organization of columns on storage for a
// zst columnar storage object.
//
// A zst object is created by allocating a RecordWriter for a top-level zng row type
// (i.e., "schema") via NewRecordWriter.  The object to be written to is wrapped
// in a Spiller with a column threshold.  Output is streamed to the underlying spiller
// in a single pass.  (In the future, we may implement multiple passes to optimize
// the storage layout of column data or spread a given zst object across multiple
//
// NewRecordWriter recursively decends the record type, allocating a column Writer
// for each node in the type tree.  The top-level record body is written via a call
// to Write and all of the columns are called with their respetive values represented
// as a zcode.Bytes.  The columns buffer data in memorry until they reach their
// byte threshold or until Flush is called.
//
// After all of the zng data is written, a reassembly record may be formed for
// the RecordColumn by calling its MarshalZNG method, which builds the record
// value in place using zcode.Builder and returns the zng.TypeRecord (i.e., schema)
// of that record column.
//
// Data is read from a zst file by scanning the reassembly records then unmarshaling
// a zng.Record body into an empty Record by calling Record.UnmarshalZNG, which
// recusirvely builds an assembly structure.  An io.ReaderAt is passed to unmarshal
// so each column reader can access the underlying storage object and read its
// column data effciently in largish column chunks.
//
// Once an assembly is built, the recontructed zng row data can be read from the
// assembly by calling the Read method on the top-level Record and passing in
// a zcode.Builder to reconstruct the record body in place.  The assembly does not
// need any type information as the structure of values is entirely self describing
// in the zng data format.
