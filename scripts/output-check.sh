# Zed is the only known tool set that outputs data in ZNG formats. Sample
# ZNG data from zq is stored in the https://github.com/brimdata/zed-sample-data
# repo. Therefore, if a change in Zed causes the ZNG output format to change,
# we'll want to know about it ASAP, since if it's a bug we'll want to fix it
# in Zed, and if it's an intentional enhancement we'll want to update the ZNG
# files in zed-sample-data so users are always finding a current copy.
#
# This script automates this check by running the Zeek TSV logs from
# zed-sample-data through zq, produces output in four ZNG variations, and
# checks that the MD5 hashes for the outputs still match the hashes stored
# in the zed-sample-data repo.

# We're intentionally not running with "set -eo pipefail" because we want to
# let all permutations run and allow the final error text to be seen before
# explicitly returning the intended error code.
