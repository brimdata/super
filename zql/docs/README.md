# Query language docs

The query language formerly known as ZQL is evolving!

If you've landed at this page because you're looking for docs regarding ZQL
in the most recent generally-available releases of Brim
([v0.24.0](https://github.com/brimdata/brim/releases/tag/v0.24.0)) and/or `zed`
([v0.29.0](https://github.com/brimdata/zed/releases/tag/v0.29.0)), follow
[this link](https://github.com/brimdata/zed/tree/v0.29.0/zql/docs/README.md)
to browse the docs for ZQL as it existed in those tagged releases.

If you're developing code or otherwise working on current commits of the
[Brim](https://github.com/brimdata/brim) and/or `zed` projects, docs for the
_current_ state of the evolving language are being actively updated and can be
found below [this link](../../docs/language/README.md).
