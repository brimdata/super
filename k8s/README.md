# Deploying zqd in Kubernetes clusters

**zqd** can be run remotely in a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster. We describe multiple approaches to this.

The Brim AWS account is used to automatically deploy and test the master branch of zq in a test EKS cluster. If you fork the repo, you may want to do something similar. We describe our procedures and Github actions for CI/CD.

[Github actions for deploying and testing zqd](deploy-with-github-actions.md)

In order to develop for Kubernetes without uses a cloud provider (like AWS) we describe how to set up a local Kind cluster (Kubenertes in Docker).

[Setting up a Kind cluster for zqd](kind-setup.md)

Once the Kind cluster is set up, there are Makefile rules for building a Docker image, and installing the zqd service with Helm.

[How to deploy zqd on Kind](dev-on-kind.md)

If you have access to an AWS account, we describe how to set up an EKS cluster for zqd development and testing.

[Setting up an EKS cluster for zqd](eks-setup.md)

When you have an EKS cluster set up, either using the link above, or using a previously existing cluster, you can use the same Makefile rules for dev deploymemts on zqd into EKS.

In the process of working all this stuff out, we took a lot of notes on the trouble-shooting steps we sometimes needed. Feel free to dig around for info in here:
