// GetWorkerConnection should only wait in unusual circumstances.
// Here is the reasoning:
// (1) In normal operation, we would expect it to return immediately,
// and not retry, since there should be a queue of workers in a
// "registered" state (long-polling).
// (2) We should tune our EKS cluster so its limiting factor is
// bandwidth to S3, not memory or CPU. So for a properly tuned cluster,
// there should be workers always available, and they should be
// requested again as they complete their S3 reads.
// (3) The retry loop here is so we will fail gracefully when the EKS
// cluster is poorly tuned, and in order to support tests where
// not enough workers are available.
// (4) We use a retry with exponential backoff because the Recruiter
// process is already maintaining long-lived connections with
// available workers, so it does not make sense to also have the
// Recruiter simultaneously maintain long connections with
// root processes that are requesting workers.
