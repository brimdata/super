	Usage: "zar [global options] command [options] [arguments...]",
	Short: "create and search zng archives",
	Long: `
zar operates on collections of ZNG files partitioned by time and stored either
on a filesystem or an S3 compatible object store. An individual
item of data (a file or object) is called a chunk, and each chunk may have
other named ZNG files associated with it, stored "near" to the chunk. For
filesystem archives, the associated files are stored in a directory next
to the chunk file.

An example of a chunk associated file is a micro-index: a ZNG file that holds
keyed records and supports very fast lookup of keys. When the key represents
a value in the associated chunk file, micro-indexes can be used to to make
searching an archive very fast.

See the zar README in the zed repository for more information:
