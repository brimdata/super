The [superdb-types library](https://github.com/brimdata/zui/tree/main/packages/superdb-types)
provides support for the super data model from within
JavaScript as well as methods for communicating with a SuperDB data lake.

Because JavaScript's native type system is limited, superdb-types provides
implementations for each of the super data model's primitive types as well as
technique for interpreting and/or constructing arbitrary complex types.
