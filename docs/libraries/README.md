# Libraries

Zed currently supports a small number of languages
with client libraries for manipulating Zed data and interacting
with a Zed service via the remote API.

Our documentation for client libraries is early but will
be improved as the project develops.

We plan to support a broad range of languages.  Open source contributions
are welcome.  Give us a holler on slack if you would like help or guidance
on developing a Zed library.
