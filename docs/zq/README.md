## TBD

This doc will give the zq overview and point to the tooling, language,
and reference docs.  **issue 3604**

## TL;DR

Zed is a pipeline-style search and analytics language for querying
super-structured data in files, over HTTP, in S3 storage, or in a
[Zed data lake](../zed/README.md).

The Zed language is simply referred to using the single term _Zed_,
and when clarification is needed other entities in the Zed system
take on a suffix, e.g., the `zed` command, a Zed lake, the Zed data model,
and so forth.
