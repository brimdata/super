&emsp; **avg** &mdash; average value

### Synopsis
```
avg(number) -> number
```

### Description

The _avg_ aggregate function computes the mathematical average value of its input.

### Examples

Average value of simple sequence:
```mdtest-spq
# spq
avg(this)
# input
1 2 3 4
# expected output
2.5
```

Continuous average of simple sequence:
```mdtest-spq
# spq
yield avg(this)
# input
1 2 3 4
# expected output
1.
1.5
2.
2.5
```

Unrecognized types are ignored:
```mdtest-spq
# spq
avg(this)
# input
1 2 3 4 "foo"
# expected output
2.5
```

Average of values bucketed by key:
```mdtest-spq
# spq
avg(a) by k | sort
# input
{a:1,k:1} {a:2,k:1} {a:3,k:2} {a:4,k:2}
# expected output
{k:1,avg:1.5}
{k:2,avg:3.5}
```
