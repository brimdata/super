### Operator

&emsp; **where** &mdash; select values based on a Boolean expression

### Synopsis
```
[where] <expr>
```
### Description

The `where` operator filters its input by applying a Boolean [expression](../expressions.md) `<expr>`
to each input value and dropping each value for which the expression evaluates
to `false` or to an error.

The `where` keyword is optional since it is an
[implied operator](../pipeline-model.md#implied-operators).

The "where" keyword requires a boolean-valued expression and does not support
[search expressions](../search-expressions.md).  Use the
[search operator](search.md) if you want search syntax.

When SuperSQL queries are run interactively, it is highly convenient to be able to omit
the "where" keyword, but when `where` filters appear in query source files,
it is good practice to include the optional keyword.

### Examples

_An arithmetic comparison_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
where this >= 2
# input
1
2
3
# expected output
2
3
```

_The "where" keyword may be dropped_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
this >= 2
# input
1
2
3
# expected output
2
3
```

_A filter with Boolean logic_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
where this >= 2 AND this <= 2
# input
1
2
3
# expected output
2
```

_A filter with array [containment](../expressions.md#containment) logic_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
where this in [1,4]
# input
1
2
3
4
# expected output
1
4
```

_A filter with inverse containment logic_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
where ! (this in [1,4])
# input
1
2
3
4
# expected output
2
3
```

_Boolean functions may be called_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
where is(<int64>)
# input
1
"foo"
10.0.0.1
# expected output
1
```

_Boolean functions with Boolean logic_
```mdtest-spq
# spq
where is(<int64>) or is(<ip>)
# input
1
"foo"
10.0.0.1
# expected output
1
10.0.0.1
```
