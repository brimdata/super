# ============================================================================
# NOTE: This is a test to protect an example shown in the Zed language
# docs. If you need to make changes to the Zed below to make the tests pass
# again after a change, the docs likely need to be updated as well.

# The "sort" is not part of the example shown in the docs, but is necessary
# because the output from the aggregation has no guaranteed sort order.

zed: |
  count() by color | sort

input: |
  {"color":"brown","name":"kiwi","flavor":"sweet"}
  {"color":"red","name":"apple","flavor":"tart"}
  {"color":"brown","name":"coconut","flavor":"nutty"}

output: |
  {color:"red",count:1 (uint64)} (=0)
  {color:"brown",count:2} (0)
