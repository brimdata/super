# Documentation

> The Brim team is small and has been busy writing code so our
> documentation lags development a bit.  We do our
> best to keep the docs up to date with the implementation, but we are
> a bit behind.  As the project
> begins to stabilize, we we will have a comprehensive set of docs.
