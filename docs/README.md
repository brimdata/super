# Documentation

> The Brim Data team is small has been  busy writing code and our
> documentation lags development a bit.  We do our
> best to keep the docs up to date with the implementation, but we are
> a bit behind.  As the project
> begins to stabilize, we we will definitely have a comprehensive set of docs.
