# The Zed Data Model

## 1. Introduction

Zed offers a new and improved way to think about and manage data.

Modern data models are typically described in terms of their _structured-ness_:
* _tabular-structured_, often simply called _"structured"_,
where a specific schema is defined to describe a table and values are enumerated that conform to that schema;
* _semi-structured_, where arbitrarily complex, hierarchical data structures
define the data and values do not fit neatly into tables, e.g., JSON and XML; and
* _unstructured_, where arbitrary text is formatted in accordance with
external, often vague, rules for its interpretation.

CSV is arguably the simplest but most frustrating format that follows the tabular-structured
pattern.  It provides a bare bones schema consisting of the names of the columns as the
first line of a file followed by a list of comma-separated, textual values
that must be parsed and inferred for their type.  The lack of a universally adopted
specification for CSV is an all too common source of confusion and frustration.

The traditional relational database, on the other hand,
offers the classic, comprehensive example of the tabular-structured pattern.
The table columns have precise names and types.
Yet, like CSV, there is no universal standard format for relational tables.
The [_SQLite file format_](https://sqlite.org/fileformat.html)
is arguably the _de facto_ standard for relational data,
but this format describes a whole, specific database --- indexes and all ---
rather than a stand-alone table.

Instead, file formats like Avro, ORC, and Parquet arose to represent tabular data
with an explicit schema followed by a sequence of values that conform to the schema.
While Avro and Parquet schemas can also represent semi-structured data, all of the
values in a given Avro or Parquet file must conform to the same schema.
The [Iceberg specification](https://iceberg.apache.org/#spec/)
defines data types and metadata schemas for how large relational tables can be
managed as a collection of Avro, ORC, and/or Parquet files.

### 1.1 The Semi-structured Pattern

JSON, on the other hand, is the ubiquitous example of the semi-structured pattern.
Each JSON value is self-describing in terms of its
structure and types, though the JSON type system is limited.

When a sequence of JSON objects is organized into a stream
(perhaps [separated by newlines](http://ndjson.org/))
each value can take on any form.
When all the values have the same form, the JSON sequence
begins to look like a relational table but the lack of a comprehensive type system,
a union type, and precise semantics for columnar layout limits this interpretation.

[BSON](https://bsonspec.org/)
and [Ion](https://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/)
were created to provide a type-rich elaboration of the
semi-structured model of JSON along with performant binary representations
though there is no mechanism for precisely representing the type of
a complex value like an object or an array other than calling it
type "object" or type "array", e.g., as compared to "object with field s
of type string" or "array of number".

The [JSON Schema specification](https://json-schema.org/)
has addressed JSON's lack of schemas with an approach to augment
one or more JSON values with a schema definition itself expressed in JSON.
This creates a parallel type system for JSON, which is useful and powerful in many
contexts, but introduces schema-management complexity when simply trying to represent
data in its natural form.

### 1.2 The Hybrid Pattern

As the utility and ease of the semi-structured design pattern emerged,
relational system design, originally constrained by the tabular-structured
design pattern, has embraced the semi-structured design pattern
by adding support for semi-structured table columns.
"Just put JSON in a column."

[SQL++](https://asterixdb.apache.org/docs/0.9.3/sqlpp/manual.html)
pioneered the extension of SQL to semi-structured data by
adding support for referencing and unwinding complex, semi-structured values,
and most modern SQL query engines have adopted variations of this model.

But, once you have put a number of columns of JSON data into a relational
table, is it still appropriately called "structured"?
Instead, we call this approach the hybrid tabular-/semi-structured pattern,
or more simply, _"the hybrid pattern"_.

## 2. Zed: A Super-structured Design Pattern

The insight in Zed is to remove the tabular and schema concepts from
the underlying data model altogether and replace them with a granular and
modern type system inspired by type systems from general-purpose programming languages.
Instead of defining a single, composite schema to
which all values must conform, the Zed type system allows values to freely
express each of their types in accordance with the type system.

In this approach,
Zed is neither tabular nor semi-structured.  Zed is "super-structured".

In particular, the Zed "record type" looks like a schema but when
serializing Zed data, the model is very different.  A Zed sequence is not
comprised of a record-type declaration followed by a sequence of
homogeneously-typed record values, but instead,
is a sequence of arbitrarily typed Zed values, which may or may not all
be records.

Yet when a sequence of Zed values _in fact conforms to a uniform record type_,
then such a collection of Zed records looks precisely like a relational table.
Here, the record type
of such a collection corresponds to a well-defined schema consisting
of field names (i.e, column names) where each field has a specific Zed type.
Zed also has named types, so by simply naming a particular record type
(i.e., a schema), a relational table can be projected from a pool of Zed data
with a simple type query for that named type.

But unlike traditional relational tables, these Zed-constructed tables can have arbitrary
structure in each column as Zed recursive types allows the field of a record
to have an arbitrary type.  This is very different compared to the hybrid pattern:
all Zed data at all levels conforms to the same data model.  Here, both the
tabular-structured and semi-structured patterns are representable in a single model.
Unlike the hybrid pattern, systems based on Zed have
no need to simultaneously support two very different data-model patterns.

In other words, Zed unifies the relational data model of SQL tables
with the document model of JSON with a _super-structured_
design pattern enabled by the Zed type system.
An explicit, uniquely-defined type of each value precisely
defines its entire structure, i.e., its superstructure.  There is
no need to traverse each hierarchical value --- as with JSON, BSON, or Ion ---
to discover each value's structure.

And because Zed derives it design from the vast landscape
of existing formats and data models, it was deliberately designed to be
a superset of --- and thus interoperable with --- a broad range of formats
including JSON, BSON, Ion, Avro, Parquet, CSV, JSON Schema, and XML.

As an example, most systems that are based on a semi-structured data would
say the JSON value
```
{"a":[1,"foo"]}
```
would be of type object and the value of key `a` would be type array.
In Zed, however, this value's type is type `record` with field `a`
of type `array` of type `union` of `int64` and `string`, or
expressed succinctly in ZSON as
```
{a:[(int64,string)]}
```
This is superstructuredness in a nutshell.

### 2.1 Zed and Schemas

While the Zed data model removes the schema constraint,
the implication here is not that schemas are unimportant;
to the contrary, schemas are foundational.  Schemas not only define agreement
and semantics between communicating entities, but also serve as the cornerstone
for organizing and modeling data for data engineering and business intelligence.

That said, schemas often create complexity in system designs
where components might simply want to store and communicate data in some
meaningful way.  For example, an ETL pipeline should not break when upstream
structural changes cause data to no longer fit in downstream relational tables.
Instead, the data stream should continue to operate and land
on the target system without having to fit into a pre-defined table,
while also preserving its super structure.

This is precisely what Zed enables.  A system layer above and outside
the scope of the Zed data layer can decide how to adapt to the structural
changes with or without administrative intervention.

To this end, whether all the values must conform to a schema and
how schemas are managed, revised, and enforced is all outside the scope of Zed;
rather, the Zed data model provides a flexible and rich foundation
for schema interpretation and management.

### 2.2 Type Combinatorics

A common objection to using a type system to represent schemas is that
random applications generating arbitrarily structured data can result in
a combinatoric explosion of types for each shape of data.

In practice, this condition rarely arises.  Applications generating
"arbitrary" JSON data generally conform to a well-defined set of
JSON object structures.

A few rare applications carry unique data values as JSON object keys,
though this is considered bad practice.

Even so, this is all manageable in the Zed data model as types are localized
in scope.  The number of types that must be defined in a stream of values
is linear in size to the input.  Since data is self-describing and there is
no need for a global schema registry in Zed, this hypothetical problem is moot.

### 2.3 Analytics Performance

One might think that by removing schemas from the Zed data model would conflict
with an efficient columnar format for Zed, which is critical in the
high-performance analytics use case.
After all, database
tables and formats like Parquet and ORC all require schemas to organize values
then rely upon the natural mapping of schemas to columns.

Superstructure, on the other hand, provides an alternative approach to columnar structure.
Instead of defining a schema then fitting a sequence of values into their appropriate
columns based on the schema, Zed values self-organize int columns based on their
superstructure.  Here columns are created dynamically as data is analyzed
and each top-level type induces a specific set of columns.  When all of the
values have the same top-level type (i.e., like a schema), then the Zed columnar
object is just as performant as a traditional schema-based columnar format like Parquet.

### 2.4 First-class Types

With a first-class types, any type can also be a value, which means that in
a properly designed query and analytics system based on Zed, a type can appear
anywhere that a value can appear.  In particular, types can be group-by keys.

This is very powerful for data discovery and introspection.  For example,
the count the different shapes of data, you might have a SQL-like query,
operating on each input values called `this`, that has the form:
```
  SELECT count(), typeof(this) as shape GROUP by shape, count
```
Likewise, you could select a sample value of each shape like this:
```
  SELECT shape FROM (
    SELECT any(this) as sample, typeof(this) as shape GROUP by shape,sample
  )
```
The Zed language is exploring syntax so that such operations are tighter
and more natural given the superstructure of Zed.  For example, the above
two SQL-like queries could be written as:
```
  count() by shape:=typeof(this)
  any(this) by shape:=typeof(this) | cut shape
```

### 2.5 First-class Errors

In SQL based systems, errors typically
result in cryptic messages or null values offering little insight as to the
actual cause of the error.

Zed however includes first-class errors.  When combined with the superstructured
data model, error values may appear anywhere in the output and operators
can propagate or easily wrap errors so complicated, pipelines of analytics
operators can be debugged by analyzing the location of errors in
the output results.

## 3. Serialization

The Zed data model is realized in a number of serialization formats.
While this document describes the data model itself,
several companion documents
specify various serialization formats that all conform to the data model:

* [ZSON](zson.md) is a JSON-like, human readable format for Zed data.  All JSON
documents are Zed values as the ZSON format is a strict superset of the JSON syntax.
* [ZNG](zng.md) is a row-based, binary representation of Zed data somewhat like
Avro but with Zed's more general model to represent an sequence of arbitrarily-typed
values.
* [ZST](zst.md) is a columnar version of ZNG like Parquet or ORC but also
embodies Zed's more general model for self-describing values.
* [Zed over JSON](zjson.md) defines a JSON format for encapsulating Zed data
in JSON for easy transmission and decoding to JSON-based clients that
lack native support for parsing ZSON or ZNG.

Because all of the formats conform to the same Zed data model, conversions between
a human-readable form, a row-based binary form, and a row-based columnar form can
be trivially carried out with no loss of information.  This is the best of both worlds:
the same data can be easily expressed in and converted between a human-friendly
and easy-to-program text form alongside efficient row and columnar formats.

## 4. Examples

To motivate the details of the Zed data model, a few examples are provided below
using the human-readable ZSON format to express Zed values.

The simplest Zed value is a single value, perhaps a string like this:
```
"hello, world"
```
There's no need for a type declaration here.  It's explicitly a string.

A relational table might look like this:
```
{ city: "Berkeley", state: "CA", population: 121643 (uint32) } (=city_schema)
{ city: "Broad Cove", state: "ME", population: 806 (uint32) } (=city_schema)
{ city: "Baton Rouge", state: "LA", population: 221599 (uint32) } (=city_schema)
```
This ZSON text here depicts three record values.  It defines a type called `city_schema`
and the inferred type of the `city_schema` has the signature:
```
{ city:string, state:string, population:uint32 }
```
When all the values in a sequence have the same record type, the sequence
can be interpreted as a _table_, where the ZSON record values form the _rows_
and the fields of the records form the _columns_.  In this way, these
three records form a relational table conforming to the schema `city_schema`.

In contrast, a ZSON text representing a semi-structured sequence of log lines
might look like this:
```
{
    info: "Connection Example",
    src: { addr: 10.1.1.2, port: 80 (uint16) } (=socket),
    dst: { addr: 10.0.1.2, port: 20130 (uint16) } (=socket)
} (=conn)
{
    info: "Connection Example 2",
    src: { addr: 10.1.1.8, port: 80 (uint16) } (=socket),
    dst: { addr: 10.1.2.88, port: 19801 (uint16) } (=socket)
} (=conn)
{
    info: "Access List Example",
    nets: [ 10.1.1.0/24, 10.1.2.0/24 ]
} (=access_list)
{ metric: "A", ts: 2020-11-24T08:44:09.586441-08:00, value: 120 }
{ metric: "B", ts: 2020-11-24T08:44:20.726057-08:00, value: 0.86 }
{ metric: "A", ts: 2020-11-24T08:44:32.201458-08:00, value: 126 }
{ metric: "C", ts: 2020-11-24T08:44:43.547506-08:00, value: { x:10, y:101 } }
```
In this case, the first records defines not just the a record type
called `conn`, but also a second embedded record type called `socket`.
The parenthesized decorators are used where a type is not gleaned from
the value itself:
* `socket` is a record with typed fields `addr` and `port` where `port` is an unsigned 16-bit integer, and
* `conn` is a record with typed fields `info`, `src`, and `dst`.

The subsequent value defines a type called `access_list`.  In this case,
the `nets` field is an array of networks and illustrates the helpful range of
primitive types in ZSON.  Note that the syntax here implies
the type of the array, as it is inferred from the type of the elements.

Finally, there are four more values that show ZSON's efficacy for
representing metrics.  Here, there are no type decorators as all of the field
types are implied by their syntax, and hence, the top-level record type is implied.
For instance, the `ts` field is an RFC 3339 date/time string,
unambiguously the primitive type `time`.  Further,
note that the `value` field takes on different types and even a complex record
type on the last line.  In this case, there is a different type top-level
record type implied by each of the three variations of type of the `value` field.

## 5. The Zed Data Model

Zed data is defined as an ordered sequence of one or more typed data values.
Each value's type is either a "primitive type", a "complex type", the "type type",
or the "null type".

### 5.1 Primitive Types

Primitive types include signed and unsigned integers, IEEE floating point of
several widths, IEEE decimal, string, byte sequence, boolean, IP address, IP network,
null, error, and a first-class type _type_.

There are 28 types of primitive values with syntax defined as follows:

| Name       | Definition                                      |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `uint8`    | unsigned, 8-bit integer  |
| `uint16`   | unsigned, 16-bit integer |
| `uint32`   | unsigned, 32-bit integer |
| `uint64`   | unsigned, 64-bit integer |
| `uint128`   | unsigned, 128-bit integer |
| `uint256`   | unsigned, 256-bit integer |
| `int8`     | signed, 8-bit integer    |
| `int16`    | signed, 16-bit integer   |
| `int32`    | signed, 32-bit integer   |
| `int64`    | signed, 64-bit integer   |
| `int128`    | signed, 128-bit integer   |
| `int256`    | signed, 256-bit integer   |
| `duration` | signed 64-bit integer as nanoseconds |
| `time`     | signed 64-bit integer as nanoseconds from epoch |
| `float16`  | IEEE-754 binary16 |
| `float32`  | IEEE-754 binary32 |
| `float64`  | IEEE-754 binary64 |
| `float128`  | IEEE-754 binary128 |
| `float256`  | IEEE-754 binary256 |
| `decimal32`  | IEEE-754 decimal32 |
| `decimal64`  | IEEE-754 decimal64 |
| `decimal128`  | IEEE-754 decimal128 |
| `decimal256`  | IEEE-754 decimal256 |
| `bool`     | the boolean value `true` or `false` |
| `bytes`    | a bounded sequence of 8-bit bytes |
| `string`   | a UTF-8 string |
| `ip`       | an IPv4 or IPv6 address |
| `net`      | an IPv4 or IPv6 address and net mask |
| `type`     | a Zed type value |
| `null`     | the null type |

> Note that `time` values correspond to 64-bit epoch nanoseconds and thus
> not all possible RFC 3339 date/times are valid.  In addition,
> nanosecond epoch times overflow on April 11, 2262.
> For the world of 2262, a new epoch can be created well in advance
> and the old time epoch and new time epoch can live side by side with
> the old using a named type for the new epoch time aliased to the old `time`.
> An app that wants more than 64 bits of timestamp precision can always use
> a named type of a `bytes` type and do its own conversions to and from the
> corresponding bytes values.  A time with a local time zone can be represented
> as a Zed record of a time field and a zone field

### 5.2 Complex Types

Complex types are composed of primitive types and/or other complex types.
The _classes_ of complex types include:
* _record_ - an ordered collection of zero or more named values called fields,
* _array_ - an ordered sequence of zero or more values called elements,
* _set_ - a set of zero or more unique values called elements,
* _union_ - a type representing values whose type is any of a specified collection of two or more unique types,
* _enum_ - a type representing a finite set of symbols typically representing categories,
* _map_ - a collection of zero or more key/value pairs where the keys are of a
uniform type called the key type and the values are of a uniform type called
the value type, and
* _error_ - any value wrapped as an "error".

The type system comprises a total order:
* The order of primitive types corresponds to the order in the table above.
* All primitive types are ordered before any complex types.
* The order of complex type classes corresponds to the order above.
* For complex types of the same class, the order is defined below.

#### 5.2.1 Record

A record is comprised of an ordered set of zero or more named values
called "fields".  The field names must be unique in a given record
and the order of the fields is significant, e.g., type `{a:string,b:string}`
is a distinct from type `{b:string,a:string}`.

A field name is any UTF-8 string.

A field value is any Zed value.

In contrast to many schema-oriented data formats, Zed has no way to specify
a field as "optional" since any field value can be a null value.

If an instance of a record value omits a value
by dropping the field altogether rather than using a null, then that record
value corresponds to a different record type that elides the field in question.

A record type is uniquely defined by its ordered list of field-type pairs.

The type order of two records is as follows:
* Record with fewer columns than other is ordered before the other.
* Records with same the number of columns are ordered as follows according to:
     * the lexicographic order of the field names from left to right,
     * or if all the field names are the same, the type order of the field types from left to right.

#### 5.2.2 Array

An array is an ordered sequence of zero or more Zed values called "elements"
all conforming to the same Zed type.

An array value may be empty.  An empty array may have element type `null`.

An array type is uniquely defined by its single element type.

The type order of two arrays is defined as the type order of the
two array element types.

> Note that mixed-type JSON arrays are representable as a Zed array with
> elements of type union.

#### 5.2.3 Set

A set is an unordered sequence of zero or more Zed values called "elements"
all conforming to the same Zed type.

A set may be empty.  An empty set may have element type `null`.

A set of mixed-type values is representable as a Zed set with
elements of type union.

A set type is uniquely defined by its single element type.

The type order of two sets is defined as the type order of the
two set element types.

#### 5.2.4 Union

A union represents a value that may be any one of a specific enumeration
of two or more unique Zed types that comprise its "union type".

A union type is uniquely defined by an ordered set of unique types (which may be
other union types) where the order corresponds to the Zed type system's total order.

Union values are tagged in that
any instance of a union value explicitly conforms to exactly one of the union's types.
The union tag is an integer indicating the position of its type in the union
type's ordered list of types.

The type order of two union types is as follows:
* The union type with fewer types than other is ordered before the other.
* Two union types with same the number of types are ordered according to
the type order of the constituent types in left to right order.

#### 5.2.5 Enum

An enum represents a symbol from a finite set of one or more unique symbols
referenced by name.  An enum name may be any UTF-8 string.

An enum type is uniquely defined by its ordered set of unique symbols,
where the order is significant, e.g., two enum types
with the same set of symbols but in different order are distinct.

The type order of two enum types is as follows:
* The enum type with fewer symbols than other is ordered before the other.
* Two enum types with same the number of symbols are ordered according to
the type order of the constituent types in left to right order.

#### 5.2.6 Map

A map represents a list of zero or more key-value pairs, where the keys
have a common Zed type and the values have a common Zed type.

Each key across an instance of a map value must be a unique value.

A map value may be empty.  

A map type is uniquely defined by its key type and value type.

The type order of two map types is as follows is
* the type order of their key types,
* or if they are the same, then the order of their key types.

#### 5.2.7 Error

An error represents any value designated as an error.  

The type order of an error is the type order of the type of its contained value.

### 5.3 The Type Type

The Zed data model includes first-class types, where a value can be of type `type`.

Two type values are equivalent if their underlying types are equal.  Since
every type in the Zed type system is uniquely defined, type values are equal
if and only if their corresponding types are uniquely equal.

### 5.4 The Null Type

The _null_ type is a primitive type representing only a `null` value.
A `null` value can have any type.

### 5.5 Named Types

A _named type_ is a named reference a specific Zed type.
Any value can have a named type and the named type is a distinct type
from the underlying type.  A named type can can refer to another named type.

The binding between a named type and its underlying type is local in scope
and need not be unique across a sequence of values.

A type name may be any UTF-8 string.

For example, if "port" is a named type for `int16`, then two values of
type "port" have the same type but a value of type port and a value of type int16
do not have the same type.

The type order of two named types is the type order of their underlying types.

### 5.6 Null Value

All Zeds type have a null representation.  It is up to an
implementation to decide how external data structures map into and
out of values with nulls.  Typically, a null value means either the
zero value or, in the case of record fields, an optional field whose
value is not present, though these semantics are not explicitly
defined by the Zed data model.
