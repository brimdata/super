var spec = &charm.Spec{
	Name:  "compile",
	Usage: "compile [ options ] spq|sql",
	Short: "compile a local query for inspection and debugging",
	Long: `
This command parses a query and emits the resulting abstract syntax
tree (AST) or runtime directed acyclic graph (DAG) in the output format desired.
Use "-dag" to specify the DAG form; otherwise, the AST form is assumed.

The query text may be either SQL or SPQ.  To force parsing as SQL,
use the "-sql" flag.

The "-C" option causes the output to be shown as query language source
instead of the AST.  This is particularly helpful to see how SQP queries
in their abbreviated form are translated into the exanded, pedantic form 
of piped SQL.  The DAG can also be formatted as query-style text
but the resulting text is informational only and does not conform to
any query syntax.  When "-C" is specified, the result is sent to stdout
and the "-f" and "-o" options have no effect.

This command is often used for dev and test but
is also useful to advanced users for understanding how SQL and SPQ syntax is
parsed into an AST or compiled into a runtime DAG.
