# `zed`

`zed` is a command-line tool to manage, search, query, and transform
data in Zed lakes and files.

## Under construction

This documentation is under construction.

## `zq`

The `zq` command is a command-line shortcut for `zed query`.

`zq` evaluates [Zed queries](../../docs/language/README.md) against input log
  files, producing an output log stream in the [ZNG](../../docs/formats/zng.md)
  format by default.

For all `zq` options, use the help subcommand:

```
zq help
```

### Examples

Here are a few examples using a small Zeek formatted log file, `conn.log`,
located in this directory. See the
[zed-sample-data repo](https://github.com/brimdata/zed-sample-data) for more test
data, which is used in the examples in the
[query language documentation](../../docs/language/README.md).

To cut the columns of a Zeek "conn" log like `zeek-cut`, and output to the
 terminal, use [`cut`](../../docs/language/processors/README.md#cut):

```
zq -z "* | cut ts,id.orig_h,id.orig_p" conn.log
```

The `-z` tells `zq` to use human-readable [ZSON](../../docs/formats/zson.md)
for its output format. The "`*`"
tells `zq` to match every line, which is sent to the `cut` processor
using the UNIX-like pipe syntax.

When looking over everything like this, you can omit the search pattern
as a shorthand.
```
zq -z "cut ts,id.orig_h,id.orig_p" conn.log
```

The default output is the binary ZNG format. If you want just the tab-separated
 lines like `zeek-cut`, you can specify text output.
```
zq -f text "cut ts,id.orig_h,id.orig_p" conn.log
```
If you want the old-style Zeek [ASCII TSV](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/log-formats.html#zeek-tsv-format-logs)
log format, use the `-f` flag specifying `zeek` for the output
format:
```
zq -f zeek "cut ts,id.orig_h,id.orig_p" conn.log
```
You can use an [aggregate function](../../docs/language/aggregate-functions/README.md) to summarize data over one or
more fields, e.g., summing field values, counting, or computing an average.
```
zq -t "sum(orig_bytes)" conn.log
zq -t "orig_bytes > 10000 | count()" conn.log
zq -t "avg(orig_bytes)" conn.log
```

The [ZNG specification](../../docs/formats/zng.md) describes how the format can
represent a stream of heterogeneously typed records. By leveraging this,
diverse Zeek logs can be combined into a single file.

```
zq *.log > all.zng
```

### Comparisons

The following usage of `cut` (repeated from above):

```
zq -f text "cut ts,id.orig_h,id.orig_p" conn.log
```

is functionally equivalent to this `zeek-cut` command:

```
zeek-cut ts id.orig_h id.orig_p < conn.log
```

If your Zeek events are stored as JSON, the equivalent `jq` command is:

```
jq -c '. | { ts, "id.orig_h", "id.orig_p" }' conn.ndjson
```

Comparisons of other simple operations and their relative performance are described
at the [performance](../../performance/README.md) page.

## `zqd`

The `zqd` command is a command-line shortcut for `zed serve`.

`zqd` serves a REST API used to manage and query a Zed data lake.
It is used as the backend service for the [Brim](https://github.com/brimdata/brim)
application.

For all `zqd` options, see the built-in help by running:

```
zqd help
```

## `zapi`

The `zapi` command is a command-line shortcut for `zed api`.

`zapi` is command-line utility for interacting with the API provided by the
`zqd`. It can be used to create data pools, import data, list info about
Zed lakes and pools, and more.

For all `zapi` options, use the help subcommand:

```
zapi help
```
