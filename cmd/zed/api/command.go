The "api" command provides client access to a Zed lake service running
on the IP and port provided in the "-host" option.  This option defaults
to localhost:9867 so you can conveniently connect to a lake service
running locally on the default port, as is automatically launched
by the Brim application for the "local Zed lake".

All of the relevant "lake" commands are available through the "api" command.
Refer to the help of the individual sub-commands for more details.`,
