# zed [![Tests][tests-img]][tests]

The zed project is a new, clean-slate design for a data engineering stack.
At zed's foundation lies a new family of self-describing
data formats based on the "zed data model", which blends the highly structured
approach of dataframes and relational tables with the loosely structured
document model of JSON.

While the zed system is built around its family of data formats, it is also
interoperable with popular data formats like CSV, (ND)JSON, and Parquet.

This repository contains tools and components used to organize, search, analyze,
and store zed data, including:

* The [zq](cmd/zq/README.md) command line tool for searching and analyzing data
* The [zqd](ppl/cmd/zqd/README.md) daemon, which serves a REST API to manage
 and query zed data lakes, and is the backend for the [Brim](https://github.com/brimdata/brim)
 application
* The [zapi](cmd/zapi/README.md) command line tool, for interacting with the
API provided by zqd
* The [zed language](docs/language/README.md) documentation
* The [zed formats](docs/formats/README.md) specifications and documentation

We believe the zed data architecture provides a powerful foundation for the
modern data lake and are actively developing tools and software components
for the emerging "zed data lake".

## Installation
