# Zed [![Tests][tests-img]][tests] [![GoPkg][gopkg-img]][gopkg]

Zed offers a new approach to data that makes it easier to manipulate and manage
your data.

With Zed's new [super-structured data model](docs/formats/README.md#2-zed-a-super-structured-pattern),
messy JSON data can easily be given the fully-typed precision of relational tables
without giving up JSON's uncanny ability to represent eclectic data.

Trying out Zed is easy: just [install](#quick-start) the command-line tool
[`zq`](docs/zq/README.md).

`zq` is a lot like [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
but is built from the ground up as a search and analytics engine based
on the [Zed data model](docs/formats/zed.md).  Since Zed data is a
proper superset of JSON, `zq` also works natively with JSON.

While `zq` and the Zed data formats are production quality, the Zed project's
[Zed data lake](docs/zed/README.md) is a bit [earlier in development](docs/zed/README.md#status).
The Zed lake will look somewhat like a lakehouse but will utilize the
Zed type system to organize its underlying data instead of often hard-to-manage
relational tables and schemas.

For a non-technical user, Zed is as easy to use as web search
while for a technical user, Zed exposes its technical underpinnings
in a gradual slope, providing as much detail as desired,
packaged up in the easy-to-understand
[ZSON data format](docs/formats/zson.md) and
[Zed language](docs/zq/language.md).

## Why?

We think data is hard and it should be much much easier.

While _schemas_ are a great way to model and organize your data, they often
[get in the way](https://github.com/brimdata/sharkfest-21#schemas-a-double-edged-sword)
when you are just trying to store or transmit your semi-structured data.

Also, why should you have to set up one system
for search and another completely different system for historical analytics?
And the same unified search/analytics system that works at cloud scale should run easily as
a lightweight command-line tool on your laptop.

And rather than having to set up complex ETL pipelines with brittle
transformation logic, managing your data lake should be as easy as
[`git`](https://git-scm.com/).

Finally, we believe a lightweight data store that provides easy search and analytics
would be a great place to store data sets for data science and
data engineering experiments running in Python and providing easy
integration with your favorite Python libraries.

## How?

Zed solves all these problems with a new foundational data format called
[ZSON](docs/formats/zson.md),
which is a superset of JSON and the relational models.
ZSON is syntax-compatible with JSON
but it has a comprehensive type system that you can use as little or as much as you like.
Zed types can be used as schemas.

The [Zed language](docs/zq/language.md) offers a gentle learning curve,
which spans the gamut from simple [keyword search](docs/zq/language.md#7-search-expressions)
to powerful data-transformation operators like [lateral sub-queries](docs/zq/language.md#8-lateral-subqueries)
and [shaping](docs/zq/language.md#9-shaping).

Zed also has a cloud-based object design that was modeled after
the `git` design pattern.  Commits to the lake are transactional
and consistent.  Search index updates are also transactionally
consistent with any ingested data, and searches can run with or
without indexes.

## Quick Start

_Detailed documentation [is available](docs/README.md#zed-documentation)._

The quickest way to get running on macOS, Linux, or Windows
is to download a pre-built release binary.
You can find these binaries on the GitHub
[releases](https://github.com/brimdata/zed/releases) page.

On macOS and Linux, you can also use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install `zq`:
```
brew install brimdata/tap/zq
```
To install `zed`, use
```
brew install brimdata/tap/zed
```
If you have [Go](https://go.dev/) installed, you can easily install `zed` and
`zq` from source by running
```
go install github.com/brimdata/zed/cmd/{zed,zq}@latest
```
Once installed, you can run the query engine from the command-line using `zq`:
```
echo '"hello, world"' | zq -
```
Or you can run a Zed lake service, load it with data using `zed load`, and hit the API.
In one shell, run the server:
```
mkdir scratch
zed serve -lake scratch
```
And in another shell, run the client:
```
zed create Demo
zed use Demo@main
echo '{s:"hello, world"}' | zed load -
zed query "from Demo"
```
You can also use `zed` from Python.  After you install the Zed Python:
```
pip3 install "git+https://github.com/brimdata/zed#subdirectory=python/zed"
```
You can hit the Zed service from a Python program:
```python
import zed

# Connect to the default lake at http://localhost:9867.  To use a
# different lake, supply its URL via the ZED_LAKE environment variable
# or as an argument here.
client = zed.Client()

# Begin executing a Zed query for all records in the pool named "Demo".
# This returns an iterator, not a container.
records = client.query('from Demo')

# Stream records from the server.
for record in records:
    print(record)
```
See the [python/zed](python/zed) directory for more details.

### Brim

The [Brim app](https://github.com/brimdata/brim) is an electron-based
desktop app to explore, query, and shape data in your Zed lake.

We originally developed Brim for security-oriented use cases
(having tight integration with [Zeek](https://zeek.org/),
[Suricata](https://suricata.io/), and
[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)),
but we are actively extending Brim with UX for handling generic
data sets to support data science, data engineering, and ETL use cases.

### Building from Source

It's also easy to build `zed` from source:
```
git clone https://github.com/brimdata/zed
cd zed
make install
```
This installs binaries in your `$GOPATH/bin`.

> If you don't have Go installed, download and install it from the
> [Go install page](https://golang.org/doc/install). Go version 1.17 or later is
> required.
