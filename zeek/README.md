This directory contains json type definitions for typed decoding of zeek ndjson logs.

Currently it contains types.json, which was computed using the [print-types.zeek](https://github.com/brimsec/zeek/blob/master/brim/print-types.zeek) script running on Zeek 3.1.

In the future it is expected to contain additional versions, generated on different versions/configurations of Zeek.
