// proc.Interface is the interface to objects that operate on Batches of zbuf.Records
// and are arranged into a flowgraph to perform pattern matching and analytics.
// A proc is generally single-threaded unless lengths are taken to implement
// concurrency within a Proc.  The model is receiver-driven, stream-oriented
// data processing.  Downstream procs Pull() batches of data from upstream procs.
// Normally, a proc pulls data until end of stream (nil batch and nil error)
// or error (nil batch and non-nil error).  If a proc wants to end before
// end of stream, it calls the Done() method on its parent.  A proc implementation
// may assume calls to Pull() and Done() are single threaded so any arrangement
// of calls to Pull() and Done() cannot be done concurrently.  In short, never
// call Done() concurrently to another goroutine calling Pull().
